It is time to start this task, this unfinished business. What do I mean? Well, to create a blog, but not just create it, turn it into an active project.

It is not the first time I have tried to work on a personal blog. For years I have tried to do it successfully. I've been through platforms like wordpress.com, wordpress hosted on my own domain, blogger, etc. But man! How difficult it is to be consistent in posting your posts frequently. Little by little one is diminishing until the blog is forgotten. A sad story of procrastination and lack of interest.
Here I am again, new platform, new blog and new attempt to be consistent. Will this time I succeed?

On this occasion I come with a different approach. I will do this blog about lifestyle, not so intimate, rather from my point of view on different topics, such as art, technology, photography and my vision and opinion on various topics. On the way I hurt by making the proper adjustments.

I hope this does not end here and the curse of lost blogs has been broken.
